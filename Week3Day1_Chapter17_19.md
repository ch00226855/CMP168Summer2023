# Week 3 Day 1
# Chapter 17 Files I/O

## Reading from Files
A program sometimes need to read data from files rather than from a user typing on a keyboard. Java provides several ways to interact with files on the machine's hard drive.

**Input Sources:**
- `InputStream`: An abstract class representing an input stream of bytes.
- `System.in`: A predefined input stream associated with the system's standard input (keyboard).
- `File`: A class representation of files.
- `FileInputStream`: A class obtaines input bytes from a file in the file system.

**A File vs. A File Object**
- A **computer file** stores data in a computer storage device (hard drive). Files can be edited and transfered from one computer system to another.
- A computer file has a name that uniquely identifies the file. A file name includes:
  - **Base name**: such as `Scanner`, `README`, `HelloWorld`.
  - **Extension**: indicates the type of content, such as `.txt`, `.java`, `.html`.
  - **Path**: indicates the directory of the file, such as `/user/username/home/Downloads/` or `C:\Users\Username\Downloads`
- A **file object** in java is a reference variable representing a computer file. It has useful methods for a Java programme to read and write on the file.
- A file name must be provided when the program defines a file object.

**Absolute Path vs. Relative Path**
- An **absolute path** indicates the path to reach a file from the **root** directory.
- A **relative path** indicates the path to reach a file from the current working directory. 
  - The current working directory of a java project can be found in Properties.
  - For files in the current working directory, no path is needed. Ex: `Text.txt`
  - For files in a sub-directory, show the name of sub-directory. Ex: `src/week2day3/FileDemo.java`
  - Use `..` to refer the higher-level directory. Ex: `../../Downloads/file.txt`
- The absolute path of a file is independent of the current working directory.


**Example**: p12.1.1, p12.1.2 Read a file using `Scanner` and `FileInputStream`.
- Import `java.util.Scanner`, `java.io.FileInputStream`, and `java.io.IOException`.
- Create a `FileInputStream` object representing a computer file.
- Create a `Scanner` object and connect it to the file input stream.
- Use methods like `nextInt()`, `nextDouble()`, or `nextLine()` to read from the file.
- Close the file input stream afterwards (otherwise the file cannot be accessed by another program).
- Close the scanner to release memory space.

**Exercise**: Create a TXT file and read the file in Java.

**Reading until the end of the file**
The `Scanner` class offers `hasNext()` method to detect whether the scanner has reached the end the file. It has several variants such as `hasNextInt()` and `hasNextDouble()` for specific types.

**Example**: Figure 17.1.1 Reading a varying amount of data from a file

**Exercise**: Counting instances of a specific word in a file

**Class `FileReader`**
The `FileReader` class provides a convenient way to read character files. It provides a `read()` method that reads one character at a time. If there is no more characters, the method will return -1.

**Exercise**: Read a TXT file using `Scanner` and `FileReader`.

**Class `File`**
The `File` class provides an abstract representation of a file or a directory. It has many useful methods including:
- `exists()`: tests whether the file or directory exists.
- `canRead()`, `canWrite()`
- `isFile()`, `isDirectory()`
- `list()`: returns a list of files and subdirectories in a directory
- `length()`
- `delete()`
- `getAbsolutePath()`
- `setReadOnly()`

## Exception Handling in File I/O
A file input/output stream requires exception handling to ensure invalid or interrupted file operation exceptions are appropriately caught and handled. 

- A `FileNotFoundException` will be thrown if the string pathname is incorrect
- An `AccessDeniedException` will be thrown if the permissions prohibit the read/write/execute action attempted
- A `FileIOException` represents a general types of exception that occurs during interactions with files.

**Exercise:** Safely read from a file and display the content
```java
try {	file = new FileInputStream("C:/Users/DancyZou/Downloads/temp.txt");
	scnr = new Scanner(file);

	// load until the end of a file
	while (scnr.hasNext()) {
		System.out.println(scnr.nextLine());
	}
} catch (IOException e) {
	System.err.println(e.getMessage());
	e.printStackTrace();
} finally {
	try {
		file.close();
	} catch (IOException e) {
		e.printStackTrace();
	}
}	
```

## Write to Files
Java provides various way to represent outputs of a program:
- `OutputStream`: represents the output of the program as a byte stream
- `PrintStream`: subclass of `OutputStream` with additional print methods
- `FileOutputStream`: an output stream writing to a file
- `File`

We can write oiutput to a file via the `PrintWriter` class.

**Syntax**
```java
PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter("myFile.txt");
PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new File("myFile.txt"));
PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream("myFile.txt"));
```

**Useful methods:**
- `append(char c)`
- `print()`, `println()`, `printf()`
- `write(String s)`
- `flush()`: flush the stream and write to file immediately
- `close()`

**Example**: p17.2.2, p17.2.3 Writing to an output text file

**Safely write to a new file**
```java
PrintWriter outStream = null; // notice this is not inside the try block
try {
	outStream = new PrintWriter(fileName); // create and connect to a new empty file
	outStream.println(text); // write text to the file
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
	System.err.println("Could not create the file " + fileName);
	e.printStackTrace();
} finally {
	if(outStream != null) {
	outStream.close(); // close the stream and release resources
	}
}
```

**Exercises:**
- Safely appending to an existing file
```java
try {
	pw = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream("data/records.txt", true));
	pw.println("I am appending to this file!");
} catch (IOException e) {
	System.out.println(e.getMessage());
} finally {
	if (pw != null) {
		pw.close();
	}
}
```
- Copy a file (read from `file1` and write the content to `file2`)

```java
File file1 = new File("data/recordss.txt");
File file2 = new File("data/records_copy.txt");
Scanner scnr = null;
PrintWriter pw = null;

try {
	scnr = new Scanner(file1);
	pw = new PrintWriter(file2);

	while(scnr.hasNext()) {
		// read and write one line
		String line = scnr.nextLine();
		pw.println(line);
	} 
	pw.flush();
} catch (IOException e) {
	System.err.println(e.getMessage());
	e.printStackTrace();
} finally {
	if (scnr != null) {
		scnr.close();
	}
	if (pw != null) {
		pw.close();
	}
}
```
- Delete a file
```java
File file = new File("data/records_copy.txt");
System.out.println("Does file exist? " + file.exists());
boolean results = file.delete();
System.out.println("Has the file been deleted? " + results);
```

**Exercise**: Save and reconstruct a database.

# Chapter 19 2D Arrays and ArrayLists

## Two-Dimensional Arrays

A **two-dimensional** array is used to contains values across multiple rows and columns. 

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/two-d.png)

**Declaration**:
```java
int[][] ary = new int[3][5];
```
- `int[][]` declares a 2D array of integers.
- `[3]` defines the number of rows.
- `[5]` defines the number of columns

**Assignment**: p19.1.1

Under the hood, a 2D array is implemented as an array of arrays. For example, `int[][] ary = new int[2][3]` allocates a 2-element array, where each array element is itself a 3-element array.

**Exercise**: Create a table of driving distances.
  |          | Boston | Chicago | Los Angeles |
  |----------|--------|---------|-------------|
  |Boston    |0       | 960     | 2960        |
  |Chicago   |960     | 0       | 2011        |
  |LA        |2960    | 2011    | 0           |
  
  A programmer can initialize a two-dimensional array's elements during declaration using nested braces, as below. 
  ```java
  int[][] numVals = {
      {22, 44, 66}, // Row 0
      {97, 98, 99}  // Row 1
};
```
Arrays of **three or more dimensions** can also be declared, as in: `int[][][] myArray = new int[2][3][5]`, which declares a total of 2*3*5 or 30 elements.

**Exercise**: Find 2D array max and min

**Exercise**: Use a 2D array in a board game.

Create the `TicTacToe` class with the following items:
- A 3-by-3 2D array representing the board.
- `player1Name`, `player2Name`, `player1Marker`, `player2Marker`, `emptyCell`
- `InitializeBoard()`
- `displayBoard()`
- `placeMarker(int rowIndex, int colIndex)`
- `isWinner()`
- `isDraw()`
- `isFull()`
- `play()`
- `saveGame()`
- `loadGame()`

## ArrayList

The array data type is invenient in the following ways:
- The size of the array must be determined up front.
- The size of the array cannot be changed afterwards.
- There lacks methods for searching, sorting, or replacing elements.

An `ArrayList` is an built-in data type that supports the above needs.

**Syntax**
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

...
ArrayList<Integer> vals = new ArrayList<Integer>();

vals.add(31);
...
```

**Remark** `ArrayList` only support reference types. Primitive types must use there corresponding **wrapper** class as the type.

**Common ArrayList methods**: Table 19.4.1

**Iterating through an ArrayList**

```java
for (int i = 0; i < aryList.size(); i++) {
  // do something with aryList.get(i)
}
```
